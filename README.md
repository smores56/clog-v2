The Clog V2
===========

The Clog V2 is a 34-key split keyboard. It has the following features:

- Choc V1 switches
- Wireless only with Seeeduino Xiao BLE controllers
- Pinky clusters (top pinky keys on the sides)
- Splay (4° between middle and ring, 8° between ring and pinky)
- SplitKB puck support for tenting
- EVQWGD001 roller support

## How to Order

The [gerber ZIP](./clog-v2.zip) has everything you'll need to get this printed.
You can order from [JLC](https://jlcpcb.com) by just uploading that ZIP archive and keeping
the default options. I'd suggest removing the order number, otherwise they'll put
one on the board somewhere randomly.

### Tips

I'd solder the parts in this order:

- Diodes
- Power switches
- MCU sockets/Headers that came with the Xiao's
- MCU pins if you're [socketing](https://docs.splitkb.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011263059-How-do-I-socket-a-microcontroller-)
- Batteries (To the +ve and -ve terminals)
- The "bodge" wire from the +ve charging pad on the controller to the "Bdg" hole
- Choc switches
