build notes
=====

* uses m2 x 6mm self tapping screw for general assembly
* choose either bottom-flat or bottom-18650
* with 2mm high bumpons, the pcb can "float" inside the case. Leave the m2 just
tight enough to keep it from sliding around.
* 18650 battery holder might need lengthening or shortening depending on whether
your battery is protected or have a bump at the end.
